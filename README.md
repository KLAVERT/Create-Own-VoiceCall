# Create-Own-VoiceCall
I wanted to build a Discord bot to improve my development skills and push myself a little further. I decided to create the bot in TypeScript to add an extra challenge. I've only been programming in JavaScript for about six months, and this is one of my first projects using TypeScript. If you have any tips for me, Iâ€™d love to hear them!
